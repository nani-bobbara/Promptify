## 🚀 The Generation Flow
1. **Blueprint Selection**: Choose a template (e.g., "Photography", "Copywriting") that matches your goal.
2. **Configure Parameters**: Use the sliders (e.g., "Chaos", "Stylize") and dropsdowns to fine-tune the AI's behavior.
3. **Select a Signature**: Apply a "Visual Signature" (e.g., Cinematic, Cyberpunk) to instantly inject a specific aesthetic into the prompt.
4. **Choose your Model**: Pick between Gemini or OpenAI models depending on your available quota.
